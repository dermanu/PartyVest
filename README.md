# PartyVest

I sewed electroluminescent wires of two colors to a west and a head. The EL-wires are then connceted to EL Sequencer from SparkFun. The sound is recorded using an pre-amplifed microphone. The vest lights up as soon as the surrounding sound exceeds a certain threshold.
The controller itself is stored in the vest and powered by 4x AA.

It's a fun and nerdy party gadget and easy to build. Hope my code might help.

I might upload the circut and photos in the future.
